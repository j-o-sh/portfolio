# Joshs official Protfolio

Welcome to the Repo of joshs official portfolio.

I do a few things in the tech world, roughly centered around frontend and user experience. However I am broadly interestet enough that I at least somewhat know my way around databases and serverside stuff as well.

## Tech stack

Since this is supposed to be a protfolio page and a tech blog, I choose [Astro](https://astro.build) running on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

This gives me the best option for a site that might get complex but mostly relies on data that can be computed at build time as well as the neccessary options to write blog content in markdown.
